                        <h3>SECURITY AWARENESS SHORT FILM</h3>
                        <p>Making a short film about security awareness emphasizes the critical need for 
                            strong cybersecurity practices in our digitally connected world. The project 
                            highlights the importance of fundamental security measures such as strong passwords 
                            and awareness of phishing methods in reducing the dangers of data breaches, 
                            identity theft, and online frauds. The film tries to educate and empower audiences 
                            by using professional interviews and real-life scenarios, arguing that everyone has 
                            a responsibility to play in ensuring digital safety. This research initiative exemplifies 
                            the media's vital role in raising cybersecurity awareness, demonstrating how informed actions 
                            can protect against widespread digital threats. It is a call to action for both individuals and 
                            companies to prioritize their online security, making it an important contribution to the cyber 
                            safety conversation.

                        <h3>NOLI ME TANGERE SHORT FILM</h3>
                        <p>I had the pleasure of editing the first three segments of the "Noli Me Tangere" short film, which was commissioned by a group of students from the University of Perpetual Help. This project allowed me to delve deeply into the heart of José Rizal's masterwork, translating the written narrative into a visual spectacular that encapsulated the novel's historical and sociological commentary. My involvement, which required close collaboration with the students, included cutting, compiling, and refining video to ensure that each scene appropriately communicated the story's emotions, themes, and cultural relevance.
                            This experience not only demonstrated my editing abilities, but also made a significant contribution to conserving and promoting Philippine literature through the eyes of a younger generation, bridging the gap between classic literature and modern storytelling.
